Once you start the survey, you are required to input your name, a link to an image and finally answer 10 questions on a scale from 1-5.

If you don't answer everything, an alert will pop up asking you to fill in everything. Once you fill in the required fields, the app will match you with whatever cat answered closest to your answers.
